# Generative Hexes

I was recently moved by some work on hex-grid pattern generation, and I decided to collect it into this repo.  My intent is to build upon this for grid designs that could influence thinking about [the I Ching in higher dimensions](http://newalexandria.org/works/i-ching/index.htm), and the [holofractal studies](https://old.reddit.com/r/holofractal/).  Ideally this will lead to some optical rendering/simulation.
